# Framebuffer console decoration kernel patch

The framebuffer decorations are a kernel feature which allows displaying
a background picture on selected consoles.

I'm not author of this patch. I actually don't understand this patch. This code has origin in
[last Gentoo](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/linux-patches.git/tree/4200_fbcondecor.patch?h=4.19)
version for 4.19 kernel. I only rebase it to new kernel versions since that time for my personal use.
